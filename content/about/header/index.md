  Hi, and welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a data scientist based in beautiful Missoula, Montana. This is where I share projects I've worked on and what I'm currently learning.

When I'm not working on a project, I can be found hiking, trail running, or playing on the river with my husband and our very enthusiastic German Wirehaired Pointer.
